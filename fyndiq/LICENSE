USER LICENSE


Fyndiq has developed a module/extension which connects a merchant’s own Magento installation to Fyndiq (in the following referred to as The module/extension). The purpose of The module/extension is to allow a merchant to upload their products to Fyndiq and keep them up to date automatically. Further, The module/extension allows a merchant to import orders from Fyndiq for processing.

The module/extension is launched for use and to facilitate co-operation between Fyndiq and merchants. Fyndiq and merchants are well aware that The module/extension has been tested but   areas of possible improvement may appear. In order to expedite and streamline corrections and adjustments the following shall apply.

The merchant is hereby granted a license to use the software of The module/extension under the limitation that the merchant does not copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense and/or sell copies of the software.

It is strictly prohibited to perform any alterations in The module/extension. If and when bugs are experienced or discovered, contact the Fyndiq Integration Team (integrations@fyndiq.se) for alterations.

The license is granted for the duration of Fyndiq’s use of The module/extension and Fyndiq reserves the right to immediately terminate the license if/when The module/extension is no longer used and/or is replaced. Upon such termination Fyndiq undertakes to provide the merchant with another solution in order to meet the purpose as explained in this user license. 

A merchant shall be held accountable for and debited any cost brought on Fyndiq due to said merchant’s breach of this user license. Upon such breach Fyndiq has the right to immediately terminate the license.

The module/extension is provided “as is”. The merchant may not hold Fyndiq liable.
